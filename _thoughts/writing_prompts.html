<h4>Muscle Memory</h4>

<p>
In the movies, characters who body swap exchange consciousness but not experience. In reality, the body holds as many memories as the mind does. A body-swapped individual may find themselves with subconscious ticks, habits, and skills, all coming from the body that they inhabit. A talented swapper can bring those experiences up into their conscious memory, to apply once they are back in their own body.

<h4>Re-generation</h4>

<p>
On Earth, certain species of flatworm can regenerate if they are injured. Severing a worm at the right location will cause two fully-formed worms to regenerate from the halves. The Stygians on planet 8A35F-G have similar capabilities. Like worms, they are soft and harmless, but they can regenerate new brains when their body is split. However, these aliens live in a hostile environment, and individuals are clumsy. They now suffer from severe overpopulation, and Earth's astronauts must intervene to prevent complete self-destruction.

<h4>The Messenger</h4>

<p>
At the graduation ceremony for Courier training, the certificate is a truth spell. That truth spell is burned into the new Courier's forehead, representing a lifetime of privilege, commitment, and burden. Couriers spend their lives alone, performing one of the realm's most important services.  They are afforded the utmost respect and confidence, not only because people can't lie in their presence, but also because they themselves cannot lie. To this day, no Courier has ever failed to deliver a message.

<h4>Windblown</h4>

<p>
It was the first thing I noticed when I arrived in Renaver: everything looked windblown. Walls listed sideways and thatching bunched leeward, giving the impression that the whole town was falling over. It was all because of an erratic wind that blew constantly through the streets. With time, I came to hate that wind. Like an overenthusiastic lover, it tugged at your skirts and stole away your breath, without leaving behind the comfort of human contact. Even inside, it scrabbled at the walls and moaned through the foundation, never letting you forget that it was there. Still, it took me two years of living in Renaver to realize that the wind wasn't a wind at all. It was breathing.

<h4>The X Team</h4>

<p>
As the Megalith got to the first skyscraper, a squad of superheroes appeared. At first, many people mistook them for the Power Rangers. But when they sprang into action, we realized we were mistaken. They may have looked the same, but their powers were very different. The biggest one became almost as big as the Megalith, while the smallest one shrank to the size of a mouse. The one who was still the size of a person gestured for us to stay back and said, "Leave this to the X Team!"
</p>

<h4>Downfall</h4>

<p>
The zombie apocalypse didn't happen the way we thought it would. Nobody even noticed it for years, and when we finally did, we thought it was a good thing. Birth rates were declining in third world nations. So were infant deaths and sexually transmitted diseases. Our programs were working. Then infertility skyrocketed in the West. Doctors noticed it first and suspected something in the water. It took us another five years to discover the virus, by which time the birth rate was down to half a percent. It was a cruel joke. Nobody felt sick, and nobody was dying. The average lifespan doubled. But nothing worked to conceive or even create babies. Humanity's last viable egg and sperm were used up in a desperate experiment. Now we are all growing old without the hope of a future. We aren't the only humans left, but we will be the last.

<h4>Lovesick</h4>

<p>
You've been sober for four months. As you receive your chip, you can't help but reflect on the journey it took to get here. You finally hit rock bottom when your last relationship crumbled into fear and resentment. That night, you locked yourself in your apartment for a week. If you couldn't see anyone, you thought, then you couldn't fall in love again. Once the shaking and crying was over, you dragged yourself to a Lovers Anonymous meeting. There, you met others who were still in love and trying to get out. One of them urged you to see a love counselor, and you did. You learned how to resist that first temptation of a crush, and how to satisfy the craving for companionship. You relapsed once, but you stopped yourself before there was even a kiss. After that, nothing could make you love again. Now you are who you always wanted to be, and stronger than ever before. Society is ready to take you back, now that you've sworn off love forever. With a smile, you accept your chip and hold it up for everyone to see.
