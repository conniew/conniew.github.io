<h4>Muscle Memory</h4>

<p>
In the movies, characters who body swap exchange consciousness but not experience. In reality, the body holds as many memories as the mind does. A body-swapped individual may find themselves with subconscious ticks, habits, and skills, all coming from the body that they inhabit. A talented swapper can bring those experiences up into their conscious memory, to apply once they are back in their own body.

<h4>Re-generation</h4>

<p>
On Earth, certain species of flatworm can regenerate if they are injured. Severing a worm at the right location will cause two fully-formed worms to regenerate from the halves. The Stygians on planet 8A35F-G have similar capabilities. Like worms, they are soft and harmless, but they can regenerate new brains when their body is split. However, these aliens live in a hostile environment, and individuals are clumsy. They now suffer from severe overpopulation, and Earth's astronauts must intervene to prevent complete self-destruction.

<h4>The Messenger</h4>

<p>
At the graduation ceremony for Courier training, the certificate is a truth spell. That truth spell is burned into the new Courier's forehead, representing a lifetime of privilege, commitment, and burden. Couriers spend their lives alone, performing one of the realm's most important services.  They are afforded the utmost respect and confidence, not only because people can't lie in their presence, but also because they themselves cannot lie. To this day, no Courier has ever failed to deliver a message. In this realm, the post of Courier is the noblest profession that any child can aspire to.

<h4>Windblown</h4>

<p>
It was the first thing I noticed when I arrived in Renaver: everything looked windblown. Walls listed sideways and thatching bunched leeward, giving the impression that the whole town was falling over. It was all because of an erratic wind that blew constantly through the streets. With time, I came to hate that wind. Like an overenthusiastic lover, it tugged at your skirts and stole away your breath, without leaving behind the comfort of human contact. Even inside, it scrabbled at the walls and moaned through the foundation, never letting you forget that it was there. Still, it took me two years of living in Renaver to realize that the wind wasn't a wind at all. It was breathing.
