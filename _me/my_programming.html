<h4>2004</h4>

<p>
I unknowingly began experimenting with web development, editing premade templates for character pages. I may have used a marquee or two. Sorry.
</p>

<h4>2011</h4>

<p>
I sat down to a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~cos126/" target="_blank">COS126</a> lecture at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> for the first time. The world of programming opened up like a jQuery accordion effect.
</p>

<h4>2013</h4>

<p>
I interned at <a href="http://www.epic.com" target="_blank">Epic Systems</a> and discovered Wisconsin cheese curds. They would forever perpetuate the web app I created for drawing and annotating heart defects.
</p>

<h4>2014</h4>

<p>
I graduated with a B.S. in computer science and began full-time front-end work on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console" target="_blank">Google Cloud Platform</a>. I also began hiding from any relatives of mine that used Google products.
</p>

<h4>2015</h4>

<p>
I decided to build a personal website. I promise I won't use any marquees.
</p>

<h4>2019</h4>

<p>
I went meta and joined the front-end team working on <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>. Now I develop for the web in more ways than one.
