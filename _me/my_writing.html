<h4>Short Stories</h4>

As the most well-researched species, short stories are common but hard to capture.
They must be approached with care, particularly while young.
Juveniles can get caught in wordsmithing traps, rendering them paralyzed and dysfunctional.

<h4>Vignettes</h4>

A very common species, though often shy.
Generally small and unassuming, they are often shoved aside by larger projects.
Their identifying feature is incompleteness, with subtle undertones reflecting life experience.
They are occasionally found nesting in collections.

<h4>Character Snippets</h4>

Members of this species immitate the looks of character development, giving a false sense of progress and accomplishment.
They have a symbiotic relationship with character art, each inspiring the other.
However, they are not to be mistaken for character plots or coherent plans.

<h4>Poetry</h4>

No.

<h4>Fanfiction</h4>

Little is known about this species. It can be dangerous, approach with extreme caution.

<h4>Novels</h4>

This species has never been observed in the wild, though many claim to have seen footprints and traces of individuals.
