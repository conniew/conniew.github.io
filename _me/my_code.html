<h4>2004</h4>

I unknowingly began experimenting with web development, editing premade templates for character profile pages. I may have used a marquee or two. Sorry.<br>

<h4>2011</h4>

I sat down to a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~cos126/">COS126</a> lecture at Princeton University for the first time. The world of programming opened up like a jQuery accordion effect.<br>

<h4>2013</h4>

I interned at <a href="http://www.epic.com">Epic Systems</a> and discovered Wisconsin cheese curds and how they would perpetuate the heart defect annotation tool I was programming for a Cardiology web application.<br>

<h4>2014</h4>

I graduated with a B.S. in computer science and began full-time front-end work on <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google's Developers Console</a>. I also began hiding from any relatives of mine that used Google products.<br>

<h4>2015</h4>

I decided to build a personal website. I promise I won't use any marquees.
