<h4>Ingredients</h4>

1 Laptop / Monitor<br>

1 copy of Photoshop CS6<br>
2 eyes<br>
7-8 fingers<br>
1 movie- / music-streaming website<br>

<h4>Digital Paintings</h4>

Preheat Photoshop CS6.
Begin with a digital sketch in a new layer, using any normal brush and black ink.
In a second layer, create a clean, solid silhouette.
Lock this layer's opacity.
Using a Hard Round Pressure Opacity brush, begin painting directly into the silhouette.
Refine as necessary, creating new layers and silhouettes for separate overlapping geometries.
Season with texture and garnish with a signature.

<h4>Figure Drawings</h4>

Start with a physical sketch on any available medium.
Using any image capture device, obtain a digital representation of the sketch.
In a new layer, line the image with a Hard Round Pressure Size brush.
Add a dash of solid color, creating a new layer for every hue.
Shade on a single layer, in solid black.
Adjust hue and opacity once shading is complete.
Highlight if desired.

<h4>Picture Books</h4>

With ruler, grid, and guides, measure out the desired canvas size with a half-inch overflow on each edge.
In a new layer, sketch a page in color.
Using the pen tool, create paths for each shape in the image.
Stuff the paths with solid color and layer by semantic relationships.
Flatten and bake to solidify before preparing a new batch.
Serve in courses.
