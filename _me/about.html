Hi, you must be lost.
Don't worry, this page isn't going to help.
</p>

<p>
Describing myself is not my strong suit.
Instead, I will just tell you some things About Me.
</p>

<p>
HELLO my name is Connie.<br>
My tablet pen's name is Jeremy.<br>
I have a dent in the back of my head.<br>
I take stairs two at a time.<br>
Edge pieces are the best.<br>
I am a black belt in Shotokan karate.<br>
I sing along to Disney.<br>
I have never broken a bone.<br>
I once set instant noodles on fire in a microwave.<br>
I love mismatched neon socks.<br>
My favorite sound is thunder.<br>
I search definitions in incognito mode.<br>
My commit history is a mess.<br>
I prefer serif fonts.<br>
I hate bugs that jump.<br>
I collect artistic bookmarks.<br>
My least favorite chore is laundry.<br>
I like pretty things.
</p>
