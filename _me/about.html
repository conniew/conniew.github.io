Hi, you must be lost, or maybe just confused.
Don't worry, this page isn't going to help.
</p>

<p>
That said, welcome to my little corner of the Internet.
Like most other humans, describing myself is not my strong suit.
Instead, I will just tell you some things About Me.
</p>

<p>
HELLO my name is Connie.<br>
My tablet pen's name is Jeremy.<br>
I have no wisdom teeth.<br>
I usually take stairs two at a time.<br>
My tablet's function keys are mapped to Z, Ctrl, Alt, and X.<br>
I am a black belt in Shotokan karate.<br>
I considered making this website's font Georgia.<br>
I can't not sing along to Disney.<br>
I like the squishy sound that raw chicken makes.<br>
I have never broken a bone.<br>
I once set instant noodles on fire in a microwave.<br>
Neon socks are my favorite, especially if they don't match.<br>
My hardware is from Apple. My software is from everywhere else.<br>
My favorite sound is thunder.<br>
I file my nails, but I rarely paint them.<br>
My commit history is always a mess.<br>
Sometimes I make little "doop" noises to myself.<br>
I always prefer crispy.<br>
I'm a hopeless romantic.<br>
I collect artistic bookmarks.<br>
My least favorite chore is laundry.<br>
I like pretty things.
</p>
