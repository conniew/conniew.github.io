If there is one thing that you should know about my art, it's that I hate it.
All of it.
It's ugly, it's unoriginal, and it's not stylized enough to be 'stylistic,' just 'wrong.'
My ideas fall flat and my process is slow, and don't even start with me about practice.
</p>

<p>
If there is a second thing that you should know about my art, it's that I love it.
Here is something that I made up in my head, and somehow I can show it to the world.
Ideas that I couldn't begin to explain can still find their way into complete strangers' minds.
It's a thrilling way to communicate.
</p>

<p>
The tragedy comes when the vision and the reality don't match.
People will swear up and down that they can't draw, or write, or sing, and this is both never the case and completely true.
On one hand, nobody is incapable of creation.
Anyone anywhere can find the medium and means to create something magnificent.
But at the same time, art is not a universal language.
It's not math, and it's not a smile.
It's different to every person and different even between views, reads, or listens.
</p>

<p>
To expect something from art is to invite disappointment, and so expectation becomes an artist's greatest failing.
Or, at least, mine.
