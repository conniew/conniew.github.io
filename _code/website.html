<p>
Hello, World!
Welcome to my website.
Here is where I post my art, writing, programming, and brainstorming projects.
It's meant to be a portfolio rather than a blog:
it's a place for me to display my best works and show off what I have made.
</p>

<p>
The website itself is also an ongoing programming project.
As a web developer, of course I needed to build the website from scratch.
This is the first iteration of the experiment, and it will continue to evolve.
</p>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>

<p>
The site itself is static, hosted on <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
As with most GitHub Pages websites, the pages are generated using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.
</p>

<p>
The templating is HTML sprinkled with <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/" target="_blank">Liquid</a> markup.
The styling is a mix of basic CSS and some <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> for convenience.
The scripting is plain JavaScript all the way.
</p>

<h3>Site Features</h3>

<h4>Theming</h4>

<p>
On a typical page, the website can be toggled between a light and dark theme using the button in the lower left.
Theming was a challenge for two major reasons: SASS build rules in Jekyll, and static website content.
This resulted in two major implementation efforts: theming in basic CSS, and storing user state with cookies.
</p>

<p>
Plain CSS theming is an awful idea. 
One day, this section will be amended to include an implementation that makes use of SASS variables and overrides.
However, for now, theming is accomplished by toggling a top-level class and repeating all color-containing CSS rules with a <code>.dark</code> prefix.
As part of this effort, it was necessary to distill all the website's colors into a small handful of values (perfect for SASS variables... but not actually using them).
Currently these colors are somewhat arbitrary hex values; however, the day for an accessibility evaluation will come, at which point these will be replaced by RGBA values that meet accessibility contrast standards.
</p>

<p>
Using cookies to store simple user state has been a much saner endeavor.
The implementation is considerably simpler than the possible alternative of propagating URL query parameters to every page in the site (which also does not carry over well for separate visits).
For every new visitor the theme defaults to "light," and the button to toggle theme is enabled only if cookies are enabled.
Toggling the theme stores a simple <code>theme=[dark|light]</code> cookie with no expiration date.
The cookie is checked at every page load to set the top-level theme class consistently for each user.
</p>

<h4>Keyboard Navigation</h4>

<p>
The site supports some global keyboard shortcuts.
One set is for using the control buttons in the gutters of a typical page, which should hopefully be self-explanatory.
Arrow keys will also help navigate between posts, and keyboard shortcuts on posts make them act more like other actionable elements, such as buttons and links.
TAB navigation is also preserved.
