<p>
It took me a while to realize my phone wasn't the only one ringing. Mine buzzed against my pocket, low-pitched and incessant. Across the street, a stranger pulled out his cell and tentatively answered. Somewhere inside, an old-fashioned analog phone shrilled loudly without response.
</p>
<p>
I fished my phone out of my pocket, but the buzzing had stopped. I checked my notifications and found no missed calls. Confused, I looked up at my dad, who was scrolling on his own phone. That was when I noticed the silence. All of the buzzing and ringing had gone quiet. The man across the street had stopped saying "hello?" and was poking at his phone in confusion. My dad looked at me and shrugged.
</p>
<p>
As I was listening to the quiet, a tiny beeping in the distance resolved into a fire alarm. The beeping got steadily louder, spreading to nearby buildings. Soon every building on the block was blaring with alarms and flashing lights.
</p>
<p>
People emerged from doorways in small groups, looking interrupted and curious. Cars on the streets pulled over as if to meet the people, but they were actually reacting to approaching sirens. A fleet of emergency vehicles had come to answer the alarms, less than a minute after they'd gone off.
</p>
<p>
My dad and I approached the curb to watch as they got closer. The first police car blazed by, lights bright in the fading day. It was followed by an ambulance and an endless stream of fire trucks, all speeding past us. Sirens drowned out every other sound.
</p>
<p>
Everyone watching cried out when we saw what was following after. It looked like every city bus and shuttle vehicle in town was following in a rumbling herd. Cars hastily pulled up onto to the sidewalk as the buses rolled down the entire width of the street. We all stumbled back to avoid the press of vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Every bus had its emergency lights flashing and its alarm blaring. Their high beams lit up the crowded sidewalks and the press of waiting people. Far down the street, the buses were peeling off to stop in front of timid clusters of pedestrians. The drivers honked their horns, and the people dared each other to step up and get on board.
</p>
<p>
As the first groups began climbing up the steps, a vague panic seized those watching. People began shoving on board, pushing others out of the way to get on a bus sooner. Buses were slowing at our curb now, and everyone waiting with us surged forward to meet them. People who had ignored the fire alarms in their buildings poured out now to fill in the gaps on the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>
I grabbed for my suitcase and missed, clutching my dad's arm instead. We were at the front of the crowd, next to a man who stood at his open car door. When a company shuttle pulled right up to us, my dad and I were practically shoved on board. I stumbled into the first seat I found, swinging my backpack onto my lap and clutching it tightly. I sat sideways behind the driver, tucking my legs in to avoid getting in the way.
</p>
<p>
The crowd was getting more frantic, shoving and yelling in panic. My dad was gripping my arm from the seat next to me, trying to keep us both calm. I winced at the press of sound from the alarms and the people around us. Neither of us tried to talk over the noise.
</p>
<p>
Our driver closed the doors early, and we pulled away from the curb with some seats still empty. Outside there was still a huge crowd of people waiting for the buses, much bigger than I thought was possible. A city bus pulled in behind us, and the crowd surged forward again to meet it. Then I lost sight of that spot as our shuttle accelerated away.
</p>
<p>
We sped down the middle of the four-lane road, past ever-growing crowds and fewer and fewer buses. All the alarms and sirens were still blaring, including a deep, shuddering city alarm that vibrated my bones. Our driver kept glancing backward in his rear-view mirrors, and for the first time I thought to wonder what we fled from. The entire shuttle craned its neck to see out the back window, but all I could see throughout the city was the same scene of twilight, bright lights, and chaos.
</p>
<p>
We got stuck in traffic getting onto the freeway, and I found myself holding my breath. It looked like the entire city was on the road, trying to get out. We crawled along until we reached the bridge, then we broke free and raced east over the lake. Everyone looked across the water, knowing that if we could just make it to the other side we'd be safe.
</p>
<p>
In the growing darkness, we sped along next to other buses that were brightly lit inside and out. I twisted in my seat to look out the window and made eye contact with a little boy. He stared back at me wide-eyed and pointed at something behind me. I turned around to look, but at that moment the view disappeared behind the trees on the eastside. We'd made it.
</p>
<p>
We slowed from a headlong rush to a steady clip, and the buses around us gradually peeled off and exited the highway. We went further into full darkness before pulling over at a transit center almost in the mountains. Everything was eerily quiet and calm as we disembarked. Once the last person jumped down, the shuttle roared to life again and headed back to the highway. We were left in the quiet darkness.
</p>
<p>
It suddenly occurred to me to check my phone, and I pulled it out of my pocket. I opened a browser, but I couldn't get signal or data. I asked my dad but he couldn't either, and others said the same. We all stood around and chattered for a while, wondering what to do. Emergency numbers weren't working either, and there weren't any wifi networks to connect to. Soon everyone dispersed, heading for a motel or a gas station or a grocery store nearby.
</p>
<p>
My dad and I went to the motel, where there was already a group of people trying to make calls on the land line. The motel's wifi wasn't working either, so we gave up and got a discounted room for the night. I didn't think I'd be able to sleep, but with nothing else to do I drifted off immediately.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, everything was working again if not back to normal. My dad called a taxi to take us back to the city, though we waited two hours for it to arrive. Once we were on our way, I spent the trip on my phone looking up news articles and social media posts.
</p>
<p>
The internet was filled with people talking about the Great Evacuation of Seattle. Everyone told stories that sounded a lot like mine, about sirens and buses and alarms. But I couldn't find anyone who bothered to explain why all of it had happened. Either it was so obvious that everyone knew, or nobody was allowed to speculate. By the time we reached the bridge, I still couldn't decide which.
</p>
<p>
Once we were back on the westside, I turned my attention to the streets. Cars were still parked up on the sidewalk, and scattered belongings littered the ground. Lawns and grassy dividers were trampled flat, and stray animals wandered the streets. But still nothing explained what had happened after we'd left. Like the internet, the city was filled with evidence and talk of the evacuation, but nothing to explain what happened.
</p>
<p>
When the taxi driver dropped us off where the shuttle had picked us up, I almost asked him if he knew what had happened. But it felt silly to mention it now, so we just paid and left and went home. Back in my room, everything was the same. I set my backpack down and turned on my computer, but I didn't know what else to search that I hadn't already. Eventually I gave up and left for class. I never did manage to find my missing suitcase.
