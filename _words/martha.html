<p>
He only ever came to her deep in the bottle, talking to someone who wasn't there.
Yearning for his Martha, who was dead two years.
Always piss-ass drunk.
</p>

<p>
Still, she loved him, and she resented her sister.
Her dead sister.
As they made love, he would say her name rhythmically, over and over.
Martha.
</p>

<p>
And she would try to be Martha.
She would try to do what he would want.
And she would wish that she were Martha.
</p>

<p>
He was gentle and kind, even piss-ass drunk.
He could never hurt his Martha, and that was why she loved him.
</p>

<p>
Afterward she would cry, and he would yell.
She looked like her, she made the same noises.
He was drunk.
She shouldn't have let him.
And she would cry again.
</p>

<p>
Then one day he came to her, piss-ass drunk, and he cried.
He said to her, Martha is dead.
I will never see her again.
</p>

<p>
He still only comes to her deep in the bottle, yearning for his Martha.
But as he moves and breathes and cries, he calls her name instead.
