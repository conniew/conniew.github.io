I am not a writer.<br><br>

While I will own to being a programmer and occasionally claim to draw ("artist" is overstating it a bit), I will at best admit to dabbling in creative writing.
Writing is not something I understand or have a process for.
I cannot evaluate it, and my exposure is incredibly narrow.
Still, I can appreciate it and aspire to it, particularly in the genres I frequent.
Plus, despite everything, I do it anyway.
<br><br>

When it comes to writing, my ideas are always bigger than my words.
Or smaller.
On one hand, I have sketchbooks covered in world and character descriptions, maps and mythologies, governments and genealogies.
I also have notepads filled with pithy phrases, clever analogies, and too-real descriptions.
What I don't have are plots.
Or character development.
Or paragraphs.
<br><br>

It's no wonder that I am not a writer, and probably never will be.
I don't have the knowledge or the discipline or the guts to go about it the right way.
And yet, I always have more to say.
