<p>"Sweetie?"</p>

<p><i>Mama.</i></p>

<p>"Honey? It's time for dinner."</p>

<p><i>It's dark.</i></p>

<p>"Honey, where are you?"</p>

<p><i>Mama, I think I'm lost, and it's dark.</i></p>

<p>"Oh my God, sweetie, what happened!"</p>

<p><i>Mama, I'm scared. It's dark, Mama, I'm scared!</i></p>

<p>"Don't leave me, sweetie, please!"</p>

<p><i>I'm not! Mama, don't cry! I'm not!</i></p>

<p>"Oh my God, oh my God, what am I going to do!"</p>

<p><i>I'm sorry I'm bad, Mama! I promise I won't be bad any more!</i></p>

<p>"Oh, sweetie, no. Please, no..."</p>

<p><i>I'm sorry, Mama! I'm sorry!</i></p>

<p>"How am I supposed to go on like this?"</p>

<p><i>Go where, Mama? Can I go?</i></p>

<p>"I miss you, honey, every day. I wish you could be here."</p>

<p><i>I'm right here, Mama. See!</i></p>

<p>"I can't do this any more, sweetie, I can't. It's too hard!"</p>

<p><i>Mama, you can do anything!</i></p>

<p>"It's been so long, darling. Do you still think about me?"</p>

<p><i>I miss you, Mama. When can we play?</i></p>

<p>"Where are you! How could you leave me!"</p>

<p><i>Mama, I'm here! I'm sorry, Mama!</i></p>

<p>"I thought of you today, honey. I was happy, and I thought of you."</p>

<p><i>I'm happy too, Mama! I love you.</i></p>

<p>"Your Papa left today, darling. Do you see him? Is he there with you?"</p>

<p><i>Mama, who's that? Why didn't he say anything?</i></p>

<p>"I'm so tired, sweetie. It's been so long."</p>

<p><i>Mama, where are you going? Can I come, too?</i></p>

<p>"I feel so lonely."</p>

<p><i>Come play with me, Mama! I love you!</i></p>

<p><i>Mama?</i></p>
