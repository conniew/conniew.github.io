Words have a way of invoking sound, image, memory, emotion, sensation, and other words.
Communicating with words is an inexact science &ndash; an experiment that can never be repeated the same way twice.
This site hosts some of my bigger experiments, each one a work in progress.
And one of the foundational building blocks of these experiments is the word.

Here are some of my favorite words:

<div id="word" onclick="updateWord()"><a></a><br>(click to refresh)</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  updateWord();
</script>
