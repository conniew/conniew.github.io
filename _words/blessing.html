The newly minted deity rose from the holy waters as naked as the day She was born. She gazed upon Her land with the eyes of a god and was pleased with what She saw. Smiling down at Her beloved people, She opened Her arms to bestow Her first blessing. But a twinge in Her throat caused a twitch in Her hand, and She mistakenly blessed a cow. As She tried to correct Her wayward aim, another spasm wracked Her chest. With a jerk of an arm, She rained meteors and tsunamis down upon Her land. Embarrassed, She brought a hand to Her lips and burped a swarm of locusts. "Oh dear," She said with a sudden twinge, "I seem to have the hiccups."
