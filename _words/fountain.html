<p>
The drinking fountain has a face. The fountainhead is a tiny bust, its lips puckered up in an "O". You turn the knob, and the mouth vomits a lumpy yarn of water. Drinking it feels like you are trying to kiss the fountainhead. At the first taste, you cough and pull back. The water tastes like wasabi. You release the knob, and the stream sputters to a stop. The fountainhead coughs and makes a face. "Was that wasabi?" it demands. You nod and tell it, "Yeah."
