<p>
The Book Room isn't a very interesting place to go, or to see.
But it's the perfect place to be.
</p>

<p>
The building actually has several rooms, each a different shape and size and color.
The only thing the rooms have in common are the books.
</p>

<p>
From wall to wall and ceiling to floor, the rooms are filled with books.
And yet, the rooms are empty.
The books cannot be seen or read.
</p>

<p>
The books fill the rooms, not with bindings and pages, but with sound.
The sound of stories.
</p>

<p>
Every book has a story, and those stories speak from within the very walls.
Characters argue from opposite sides, and horses clip-clop past.
Dragons roar overhead, and voices whisper from every corner.
</p>

<p>
Each room has a perfect spot to listen, where the voices come together and the world is painted in sound.
The story surrounds you with its chatter and music, and just for a while, you are a part of that world.
</p>

<p>
There is nowhere to go in the Book Room, and nothing to see.
But if you find that magical spot in a room, it's the perfect place to be.
